# Featured Properties & Filter Fixes - Complete âœ…

## What Was Fixed

### 1. âœ… Properties Page Filtering (FIXED)
**Issue**: Filter UI existed but no filtering logic - filters did nothing  
**Solution**: Implemented complete filtering logic with:
- **Search filter**: Searches in property title and location
- **Property type filter**: Filters by apartment/villa/townhouse
- **Location filter**: Filters by specific locations
- **Price range filter**: Four brackets (0-500, 500-1000, 1000-2000, 2000+)

**File**: `src/pages/Properties.js`
- Added `filteredProperties` computed variable
- Changed from mock data priority to database-first approach
- Updated property count and grid to use filtered results

### 2. âœ… Dynamic Properties Display (FIXED)
**Issue**: Properties page showed mock data instead of database data  
**Solution**: Changed data source priority
- Before: `properties = fetchedProperties && fetchedProperties.length > 0 ? fetchedProperties : mockProperties`
- After: `properties = fetchedProperties?.data || []`
- Now uses database as primary source, empty array if no data

### 3. âœ… Featured Property Toggle - Admin Panel
**Issue**: No way to mark properties as featured in admin  
**Solution**: Added featured column with toggle switch

**File**: `src/pages/admin/AdminProperties.js`
- Added "Featured" column to table (with gold Switch component)
- Created `toggleFeaturedMutation` to update featured status
- Added `handleToggleFeatured` function
- Switch shows gold color (#D4AF37) when active
- Invalidates all property caches on toggle (adminProperties, properties, featured-properties)

### 4. âœ… Featured Property Toggle - Property Form
**Issue**: No featured field when creating/editing properties  
**Solution**: Added featured toggle to form

**File**: `src/pages/admin/AdminPropertyForm.js`
- Added `featured: false` to initial formData state
- Added featured field to property loading in useEffect
- Created beautiful featured toggle UI next to Status field
- Shows "Show on Homepage" chip that changes color when featured
- Gold-themed Switch component matching design system

### 5. âœ… Featured Properties on Homepage (FILTERED)
**Issue**: Homepage showed ALL properties, not just featured ones  
**Solution**: Added featured filter

**File**: `src/pages/Home.js`
- Before: `.slice(0, 4)` - showed first 4 properties regardless
- After: `.filter(property => property.featured === true).slice(0, 4)`
- Now only shows properties marked as featured, max 4

## How to Use

### Marking Properties as Featured

#### Option 1: Admin Properties List
1. Go to Admin Panel â†’ Properties
2. Find the property row
3. Toggle the **Featured** switch (gold = featured)
4. Property will immediately appear/disappear from homepage

#### Option 2: Property Form
1. Go to Admin Panel â†’ Properties â†’ Edit or Add Property
2. Scroll to the **Featured Property** toggle (next to Status)
3. Turn it ON to show on homepage
4. Shows "Show on Homepage" chip when active
5. Save the property

### Using Property Filters (Public Page)
1. Visit `/properties` page
2. Use the filter bar:
   - **Search**: Type property name or location
   - **Property Type**: Select apartment/villa/townhouse
   - **Location**: Select specific area in Dubai
   - **Price Range**: Select budget bracket
3. Results update instantly with matching properties
4. Count shows: "Showing X properties"

## Technical Details

### Database Requirements
- Properties table must have `featured` BOOLEAN column
- Default value should be `false`
- Already exists if you created properties via the form

### Cache Invalidation
All three mutations now invalidate these query keys:
- `['adminProperties']` - Admin list
- `['properties']` - Public list
- `['featured-properties']` - Homepage featured section

This ensures UI stays in sync across all pages.

### Filter Logic
Properties match if ALL selected filters match:
- Search: Matches if title OR location contains search term (case-insensitive)
- Type: Matches if type equals selected or filter is "all"
- Location: Matches if location equals selected or filter is "all"
- Price: Matches if price falls within selected range bracket

## UI Design

### Featured Toggle (Admin Panel)
- Gold Switch component (#D4AF37)
- In table between "Views" and "Status" columns
- Click to instantly toggle featured status
- Visual feedback with gold color

### Featured Toggle (Property Form)
- Custom bordered box with label
- "Featured Property" label + "Show on Homepage" chip
- Chip changes color when featured (gold theme)
- Gold Switch on the right
- Clean, professional appearance

### Featured Properties (Homepage)
- Shows maximum 4 featured properties
- Filtered from all available properties
- If no featured properties exist, shows empty section
- Updates automatically when properties are featured/unfeatured
