# Fix Blog Post Creation Error - Step by Step Guide

## Problem
When creating a new blog post, you're getting a **400 Bad Request** error because:
1. The database schema has `featured_image` column, but the code uses `image`
2. The database schema expects `author_id` (foreign key to agents), but the code sends `author` as text
3. The image upload function wasn't being handled correctly

## Solution

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zmklauljzmdirdpzpadb/sql
2. Click on "SQL Editor"
3. Copy and paste the following SQL:

```sql
-- Fix blog_posts table to match the application code

-- Add 'author' column as TEXT (since the form sends author as a string)
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS author TEXT;

-- Add 'image' column (since the form sends 'image', not 'featured_image')
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS image TEXT;

-- Make author_id nullable since we're using author as text instead
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ALTER COLUMN author_id DROP NOT NULL;

-- Optional: Copy data from featured_image to image if any exists
UPDATE blog_posts SET image = featured_image WHERE featured_image IS NOT NULL AND image IS NULL;

-- SUCCESS
DO $$
BEGIN
  RAISE NOTICE '✅ Blog posts table updated successfully! Added author and image columns.';
END $$;
```

4. Click "Run" to execute the SQL
5. You should see a success message

### Step 2: Code Changes (Already Applied)

I've already fixed the `AdminBlogForm.js` file to properly handle image uploads. The issue was that the `uploadImage` function returns an object `{ data: { path, url }, error }`, but the code was treating it as if it returned just the URL.

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. Save all your work
2. Restart your development server if needed
3. Go to the Admin panel: http://localhost:3000/admin/blog
4. Click "Create New Post"
5. Fill in the form:
   - Title: "Test Blog Post"
   - Category: Select any category
   - Author: Type your name (e.g., "Talha Musharraf")
   - Content: Add some test content
   - Upload an image
   - Status: Published or Draft
6. Click "Publish Post" or "Save Draft"

### Step 4: Verify the Blog Storage Bucket

You need to make sure the 'blog' storage bucket exists in Supabase:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zmklauljzmdirdpzpadb/storage/buckets
2. Check if a bucket named "blog" exists
3. If it doesn't exist:
   - Click "New bucket"
   - Name: `blog`
   - Public: ✓ (checked)
   - File size limit: 5MB
   - Allowed MIME types: `image/*`
   - Click "Create bucket"

### What Was Fixed

1. **Database Schema**: Added `author` (TEXT) and `image` (TEXT) columns to match the application code
2. **Image Upload**: Fixed the AdminBlogForm to properly extract the URL from the upload result
3. **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for failed uploads

### Alternative Solution (If you prefer to keep the original schema)

If you want to keep the original database schema with `featured_image` and `author_id`, you would need to:

1. Modify the form to use agent selection instead of text input
2. Change the API calls to use `featured_image` instead of `image`

But the solution I provided above is simpler and matches your current frontend implementation.

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Check the browser console** for the exact error message
2. **Check Supabase logs**: Go to Logs > Postgres Logs in your Supabase dashboard
3. **Verify the storage bucket** exists and is public
4. **Check RLS policies**: Make sure authenticated users can insert into blog_posts
